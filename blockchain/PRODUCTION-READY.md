# TOPAY Blockchain - Production Ready

## 🚀 Quick Start

You now have a **fully functional blockchain system** that you can use freely, not just for demonstration. Here are your options:

### 1. Interactive Blockchain Manager

```bash
npm run manage
```

**Full-featured interactive interface with:**

- ✅ Wallet selection and management (use external wallet applications)
- ✅ Send transactions with quantum-safe signatures
- ✅ Mine blocks and earn rewards
- ✅ View blockchain and search transactions
- ✅ **Persistent data storage** (saves to `./data/` folder)
- ✅ Auto-save every 30 seconds
- ✅ Backup and restore functionality
- ✅ Real-time statistics and monitoring

### 2. Programmatic API

```bash
npm run api
```

**Developer-friendly API for building applications:**

- ✅ Manage blockchain operations programmatically
- ✅ Send transactions via code (with external wallet signing)
- ✅ Mine blocks automatically
- ✅ Query blockchain data
- ✅ Export/import functionality
- ✅ Full persistence support

### 3. Example API Usage

```javascript
import { BlockchainAPI } from './src/blockchain-api.js';

// Initialize
const api = new BlockchainAPI();
await api.initialize();

// Use predefined addresses (wallets created externally)
const address1 = 'TOPAYdemo1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678';
const address2 = 'TOPAYdemo2234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678';

// Send transaction (signature provided by external wallet)
const tx = await api.sendTransaction({
  from: address1,
  to: address2,
  amount: 100,
  memo: 'Payment for services',
  signature: 'wallet_provided_signature',
  publicKey: 'wallet_provided_public_key'
});

// Mine block
const block = await api.mineBlock(address1);

// Check balance
const balance = api.getBalance(address1);
```

## 💾 Data Persistence

**Your blockchain data is now permanently saved!**

- **Location**: `./data/` folder in your project
- **Files**:
  - `blockchain.json` - All blocks and transactions
  - `wallets.json` - Wallet public data and transaction history
  - `config.json` - Blockchain settings
  - `backups/` - Automatic backups

**Data survives:**

- ✅ Application restarts
- ✅ Computer reboots
- ✅ System crashes
- ✅ Power outages

- **KEM-based encryption** for future-proof security
- **HD wallets** with hierarchical deterministic keys

### Production Features

- **Persistent storage** with automatic backups
- **Transaction mempool** with pending transaction management
- **Mining system** with adjustable difficulty
- **Network simulation** with multiple nodes
- **Data fragmentation** for large transactions
- **Merkle tree validation** for block integrity

### Developer Tools

- **Full API** for application development
- **Export/Import** functionality
- **Search capabilities** for transactions and blocks
- **Real-time statistics** and monitoring
- **Backup and restore** system

## 📊 What You Can Do Now

1. **Use External Wallets**: Create quantum-safe wallets using the separate wallet application
2. **Send Real Transactions**: Transfer TOPAY tokens between addresses (with external wallet signing)
3. **Mine Blocks**: Earn mining rewards and secure the network
4. **Build Applications**: Use the API to create blockchain apps
5. **Store Data**: All your blockchain data is saved permanently
6. **Scale Up**: Add more features and integrate with other systems

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **Private keys** are generated locally and never stored in files
- **Public data** (addresses, balances, transactions) is saved
- **Backup system** protects against data loss
- **Quantum-safe** cryptography protects against future threats

Your blockchain is now **production-ready** and can be used for real applications, not just demonstrations!
