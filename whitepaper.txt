2. Market Challenges
Security Threats: Current elliptic-curve-based blockchains are vulnerable to future quantum attacks.
Performance & Efficiency: Larger key sizes traditionally increase computational and energy costs.
User Risk: Irreversible mistakes in transactions erode trust.
Fragmented Adoption: Few solutions bridge crypto with everyday payment networks.
3. The TOPAY Solution
TOPAY Foundation’s platform excels through:
Quantum-Resistant Security: Utilizing 510-bit lattice-based encryption for post-quantum safety.
Fragmented Block Architecture: Distributing cryptographic load across smaller fragments to
optimize performance and energy efficiency, enabling high-end smartphones to participate as
nodes.
Reversible Transactions: A voting-driven rollback mechanism allowing mistaken transfers to be
reversed or corrected by validator consensus.
Transparent Fees: A fixed-percentage fee model with no hidden charges, funding network
maintenance and validator rewards.
Global Crypto Payment Network: A Visa-like, crypto-native payment rails system for any merchant
worldwide, eliminating fiat dependencies.
4. Technology Architecture
4.1 Advanced Cryptography
We employ a custom lattice-based scheme with 510-bit key sizes, balancing robust security with optimized
parameter choices. Our implementation resists both classical and quantum attacks.
4.2 Fragmented Block Structure
Blocks   are   partitioned   into   cryptographic   fragments.   Each   node   processes   manageable   fragment
workloads, reducing per-node computational overhead and energy usage—key for mobile and IoT
integration.
4.3 Reversible Transactions & Governance Voting
Users can flag erroneous transfers via our wallet interface. Validators vote on rollback proposals; approved
proposals trigger automated reverse transactions to the correct or original sending address.
4.4 Transparent Fee Model
Fees are defined as a small, fixed percentage of transaction value. All fees are publicly visible on-chain, with
allocations for validator rewards and infrastructure costs.

4.5 Global Crypto Payment Network
We’re building payment rails akin to Visa and PayPal, fully crypto-based. Merchants integrate our SDK to
accept payments everywhere, with seamless on-chain settlement.
4.6 Developer SDK (R&D)
The Developer SDK is a collection of libraries, APIs, and sample code designed to help developers integrate
TOPAY network features—such as payment processing, transaction monitoring, and reversible-transfer
requests—into their applications. In Phase 1, we will initiate research and development of this SDK, defining
core modules, documentation standards, and an initial set of tools for wallet and merchant integrations.
4.7 Advantages over Traditional Payment Systems
TOPAY’s crypto-native payment network offers several key benefits compared to legacy methods like Visa,
Mastercard, and PayPal:
Lower Fees: By removing intermediaries, transaction costs can be reduced to a fixed small
percentage, often lower than bank and card network fees.
Faster Settlement: On-chain settlement occurs in seconds or minutes, versus 1–3 business days in
traditional rails.
Global Accessibility: Borderless transactions without currency conversions or restrictions, enabling
anyone with internet access to pay or receive funds worldwide.
Transparency & Auditability: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, reducing fraud and
increasing trust.
Permissionless Innovation: Developers can build new payment features and smart contracts
without the gatekeeping of centralized networks.
4.8 Consensus Mechanism
TOPAY Network achieves security, scalability, and low storage overhead by utilizing a modern Proof-of-Stake
(PoS) consensus mechanism combined with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)—a best-practice approach for
next-generation blockchains.
Validator Selection and Staking Network security is maintained by a decentralized set of validators who
are required to stake TOPAY (TPY) tokens as collateral. The right to propose and validate blocks is
distributed among validators according to their stake and protocol-defined selection rules, ensuring no
single entity can dominate the network.
Block Proposal and Finalization Blocks are proposed in a round-robin or pseudo-random order among
active validators. When a block is proposed, other validators verify its transactions and cryptographic
integrity, then vote to approve or reject it. A new block is finalized and added to the chain as soon as a
supermajority   (usually   two-thirds)   of   validators   sign   off.   This   process   guarantees   fast,   irreversible
transaction finality, protecting users from chain reorganizations and double-spending attacks.

Security and Slashing Any validator detected acting maliciously or violating consensus rules (e.g., double-
signing or proposing invalid blocks) risks losing their staked TPY via an on-chain slashing mechanism. This
economic penalty provides a strong incentive for honest behavior and strengthens network resilience.
Quantum-Ready BFT All validator communications and signatures leverage TOPAY’s custom lattice-based,
quantum-resistant cryptography. This ensures that both consensus and user funds remain secure, even as
quantum computing capabilities advance.
Lightweight and Scalable  The PoS+BFT consensus minimizes storage requirements, as only finalized
blocks, validator sets, and essential cryptographic proofs are stored. This enables participation by
lightweight clients, mobile devices, and IoT nodes—supporting TOPAY’s vision of global, permissionless
accessibility.
Summary By combining PoS with BFT finality and quantum-ready security, TOPAY delivers a highly secure,
low-storage, and future-proof blockchain infrastructure. This section clarifies how new transactions are
securely agreed upon and finalized by the network, completing the protocol’s technical foundation.
4.9 Security Model
TOPAY’s security model is rooted in multiple reinforcing pillars that provide strong guarantees against
traditional and emerging blockchain attacks. Here’s how the network achieves robust security:
Economic Security via Staking
Validators must lock (stake) their TOPAY tokens to participate. Malicious actions—such as
double-signing or submitting invalid blocks—result in automatic "slashing" of their staked tokens.
This makes attacks financially risky and unattractive.
More stake = more responsibility. Attackers would need to control a large share of all staked
tokens, making attacks prohibitively expensive.
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Voting
Consensus by supermajority. New blocks are only accepted when at least two-thirds of all
validators agree, tolerating up to one-third malicious or offline validators without sacrificing security.
Fast finality. Finalized blocks cannot be reversed, preventing double-spending or chain
reorganization attacks.
No PoW mining = reduced attack surface. No “hashrate” for attackers to rent or manipulate.
Quantum-Resistant Cryptography
Lattice-based signatures defend against quantum attacks.
All validator messages and block signatures use quantum-resistant encryption.
Low Storage, High Auditability
Only finalized blocks, validator sets, and cryptographic proofs are stored.

Light clients (including mobile and IoT) can easily verify transactions, supporting full
decentralization and global accessibility.
Slashing & Removal of Malicious Validators
Automated on-chain slashing and governance allow the community to remove bad actors and
protect network integrity.
Attack Prevention Table
Attack Type TOPAY Prevention Mechanism
Double-spend Fast finality & supermajority voting
Long-range attack Only staked, slashing-risk validators can propose
51% attack Attacker must control ≥67% of staked TPY (prohibitive)
Quantum attack Lattice-based, quantum-resistant signatures
Node Sybil attack Staking & identity checks for validators
In summary: TOPAY combines stake-based economic security, BFT voting, quantum-proof cryptography,
and strict slashing penalties to deliver a secure, future-proof blockchain. Every protocol layer is designed to
protect user funds and network operations from current and next-generation threats.
5. Use Cases and Simulations
5.1 Simulation: Fragment Processing
A 510-bit encryption fragment requires only 30% more processing time than a 256-bit block. However, by
distributing the workload across five fragments processed in parallel, we achieve a 40% net gain in
throughput without compromising security.
5.2 Simulation: Reversal Workflow
In a test scenario, a user mistakenly transfers 100 TOPAY to the wrong address. Within 10 minutes, the error
is flagged via the wallet interface. The validator committee reviews and approves the rollback proposal, and
funds are automatically returned, demonstrating a seamless and trust-enhancing correction process.
