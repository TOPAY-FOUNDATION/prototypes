# PowerShell Script Analyzer Fixes

## Fixed Issues in `build-installer.ps1`

### Issue 1: Unused Variable `$BuildDir`

- **Location**: Line 17
- **Problem**: Variable was assigned but never used
- **Solution**: Removed the unused variable declaration
- **Code Change**:

  ```powershell
  # Before
  $BuildDir = Join-Path $ProjectDir "build"
  
  # After
  # Variable removed as it was not used anywhere in the script
  ```

### Issue 2: Unused Variable `$packageJsonPath`

- **Location**: Line 38 (in `Test-Dependencies` function)
- **Problem**: Variable was assigned but never used
- **Solution**: Added validation logic to use the variable
- **Code Change**:

  ```powershell
  # Before
  $packageJsonPath = Join-Path $ProjectDir "package.json"
  $nodeModulesPath = Join-Path $ProjectDir "node_modules"
  
  # After
  $packageJsonPath = Join-Path $ProjectDir "package.json"
  $nodeModulesPath = Join-Path $ProjectDir "node_modules"
  
  # Verify package.json exists
  if (-not (Test-Path $packageJsonPath)) {
      throw "package.json not found at: $packageJsonPath"
  }
  ```

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Code Quality**: Eliminates PSScriptAnalyzer warnings
2. **Better Error Handling**: Added validation for package.json existence
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removed unnecessary variables
4. **Improved Reliability**: Script now validates required files before proceeding
